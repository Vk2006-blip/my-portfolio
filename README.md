# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS to showcase my projects and skills.  
The focus was on creating a clean layout .I used Flexbox and media queries to improve alignment and mobile usability.  
This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals in structuring web pages and styling them effectively.
